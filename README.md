<h1 align="center">🙋🏻‍♂️ Hello to all the lost ones,  I'm Aynur</h1> 
<h2 align="center">I'm a mobile developer, predominantly writing Android apps, but can occasionally write a couple screens and features on flutter. At the moment I'm working on an app for the Enterprise sphere, and I've also worked on an analog of Uber, but in the field of trucking. I am very interested in developing in the mobile sphere, and also sometimes I can get passionate about solving problems in leetcode, but I don't have enough time for it critically. </h2>
